Frequent category imputation with Scikit-learn ==> SimpleImputer
Scikit-learn provides a class to make most of the most common data imputation techniques.

The SimpleImputer class provides basic strategies for imputing missing values, including:

Mean and median imputation for numerical variables
Most frequent category imputation for categorical variables
Arbitrary value imputation for both categorical and numerical variables
Advantages
Simple to use if applied to the entire dataframe
Maintained by the scikit-learn developers: good quality code
Fast computation (it uses numpy for calculations)
Allows for grid search over the various imputation techniques
Allows for different missing values encodings (you can indicate if the missing values are np.nan, or zeroes, etc)
Limitations
Returns a numpy array instead of a pandas dataframe, inconvenient for data analysis
Needs to use additional classes to select which features to impute ==>
requires more lines of code
additional classes still in beta (may change without warning)
not so straightforward to use anymore.
