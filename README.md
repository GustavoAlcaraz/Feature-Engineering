# Feature-Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering can be considered as applied machine learning itself - Wikipedia

Concepts: Missing data, Variable Distribution, Rare Labels, Linear Assumptions, Outliers, Feature Magnitude

I used the lessons learned in the "Feature Engineering for Machine Learning" course, by Soledad Galli, PhD
