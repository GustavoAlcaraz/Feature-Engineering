 Automatic selection of best imputation technique with Sklearn

In this notebook we will do a grid search over the imputation methods available in Scikit-learn to determine which imputation technique works best for this dataset and the machine learning model of choice.

We will also train a very simple machine learning model as part of a small pipeline.

We will use the House Price dataset.
